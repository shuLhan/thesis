Dari analisis fitur vandalisme pada \ref{bab:02:fitur_vandalisme} kemudian
ditransformasikan ke dalam sebuah program.
Program ekstraksi fitur kemudian dijalankan dengan input dataset PAN-WVC-10
dan PAN-WVC-11 yang telah dibersihkan pada subbab
\ref{bab:03:persiapan_data_pelatihan} dan
\ref{bab:03:persiapan_data_pengujian},
sehingga menghasilkan dataset fitur yang bernilai kontinu.
Implementasi program pembersihan data dan generator fitur ini dapat dilihat dan
digunakan secara terbuka pada repositori \texttt{wvcgen}
\footnote{\url{https://github.com/shuLhan/wvcgen}}.
Nilai dari fitur yang desimal dibulatkan menjadi lima angka dibelakang koma.

Urutan ekstrasi fitur adalah sebagai berikut: \textit{editid}, anonim,
panjang komentar, peningkatan ukuran, rasio ukuran, rasio huruf besar dan
kecil, rasio huruf besar, rasio angka, rasio non-alfanumerik, diversitas
karakter, distribusi karakter, laju kompresi, token umum, frekuensi rerata
kata, kata terpanjang, urutan karakter terpanjang, frekuensi kata vulgar, impak
kata vulgar, frekuensi kata subjek, impak kata subjek, frekuensi kata bias,
impak kata bias, frekuensi kata pornografi, impak kata pornografi, frekuensi
kata buruk, impak kata buruk, frekuensi semua kategori kata, impak semua
kategori kata, dan kelas. Berikut contoh lima baris awal dan akhir dari hasil
ekstraksi fitur pada dataset PAN-WVC-10.
