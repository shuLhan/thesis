Previous papers group the features into three categories which are metadata,
text, and language.
This paper use four metadata features, 11 text features, and 10
language features which has been used and analyzed in Mola-Velasco paper
\cite{mola2012wikipedia}.

All previous feature then implemented in a program.
The program then executed on PAN-WVC-10 and PAN-WVC-11 set that has been
prepared in section \ref{subsection:data_preparation}, which generate features
dataset contain continous values.
The implementation for combining, cleaning, and generating the features is
published as open source software as \texttt{wvcgen}
\footnote{\url{https://github.com/shuLhan/wvcgen}}.
