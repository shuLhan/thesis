\subsection{Analysis of Resampling}

The effect of resampling SMOTE and LNSMOTE is different between RF and CRF.
On RF, LNSMOTE give a better accuracy than SMOTE, with average increased value
is 0.4\%.
On CRF, SMOTE overall give better performance than LNSMOTE with the highest AUC
value is returned by CRF on SMOTE with 100 stages and 2 trees.
SMOTE and LNSMOTE increase F-Measure and accuracy on RF, but on CRF is vice
versa.
The drawback of using LNSMOTE is increased value of FPR is higher than using
SMOTE, as illustrated at ROC curve in figure \ref{fig:roc} (c) and (d).
