When detecting vandalism, it is better to receive false positive than missing
vandalism edit.
Wrong classification, when regular edit detected as vandalism, will give no
effect on reader, but missing on vandalism edit can lead to information loss,
fault information, or disturb the reader.
For this reason, our evaluation based on true-positive rate of classifier
performance.
True-positive rate (TPR) or recall is the number of actual positive samples
divided by the sum of positive sample classified as positive and positive
sample classified as negative (false-positive).
TPR has a value between 0 and 1, with value approaching to 0 indicate poor
performance and value approaching 1 indicate good performance.
Result of testing are given in terms of performance of each classifier on table
\ref{tab:stats} and training computation time in
\figurename\ \ref{graph:runtimes}.

Result from CRF classifer on LNSMOTE with 200 stages and 1 tree have the
highest TPR value $0.9904$.
RF classifier without resampling gave the lowest TPR $0,1654$.
