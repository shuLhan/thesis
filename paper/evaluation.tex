When detecting vandalism, it is better to receive false positive than missing
vandalism edit.
Wrong classification, when regular edit detected as vandalism, will give no
effect on reader, but missing on vandalism edit can lead to information loss,
fault information, or disturb the reader.
For this reason, our evaluation based on true-positive rate of classifier
performance.
True-positive rate (TPR) or recall is number of actual positive samples divided
by sum of sample positive classified as positive and sample positive classified
as negative (false-positive).
TPR has a value between 0 and 1, with value approaching to 0 indicate poor
performance and value approaching 1 indicate good performance.
Result of testing are given in terms of performance of each classifier on table
\ref{tab:stats} and training computation time on figure \ref{graph:runtimes}.

Result from CRF classifer on LNSMOTE with 200 stages and 1 tree have the
highest TPR value $0.9904$.
RF classifier without resampling gave the lowest TPR $0,1654$.

From the computation time, CRF classifier is faster than RF on all training.
Using RF and CRF with 50 stages and 4 trees as comparison, CRF without
resampling is 11 times faster than RF, and for dataset that has been resampled
with SMOTE and LNSMOTE, CRF is 1.6 times faster than RF.
