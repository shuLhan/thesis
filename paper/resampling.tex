PAN-WVC-10 without resample contain 2,394 positive or vandalism samples and
30,045 negative or regular samples.
To get a balanced class, the dataset then resampled using SMOTE and LNSMOTE for
positive class.
For SMOTE, the parameter used for resampling is 1,200\% and parameter for
K-Nearest-Neighbour (KNN) is 5, which output 28,728 synthetic samples, total of
positive sample combined with original sample result in 31,122 positive
samples.
Parameter for resampling using LNSMOTE is similar with SMOTE, which generate
28,588 positive synthetic samples, in total of 30,892 positive samples.
The implementation for SMOTE and LNSMOTE published as open source software
\footnote{\url{https://github.com/shuLhan/go-mining/tree/master/resampling}}.
