SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) method, proposed by Chawla
\cite{chawla2002smote},
use oversampling approach in which the minority class are resampled by creating
their synthetic samples not by replacing majority sample with minority class.
Synthetic sample created by application, operated on feature space.

Synthetic sample created with the following procedure,
\begin{itemize}
\item Pick $k$ nearest neigbour of minority sample randomly.
\item Calculate the difference between feature vector sample with their
neighbours.
\item Multiply the difference with random real number, ranged between 0 to 1.
\item Add their result to new feature vector.
\end{itemize}

The synthetic sample will be created in random line segment between two
selected features.
This approach effectively stimulate the learning region from minority class
become larger without causing over-fitting.
